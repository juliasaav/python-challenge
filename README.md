#Module 3 Challenge

For this challenge, I heavily relied on exercises done from that week.  To create the file path, open os, and open the csv reader, I used the same lines of code for both of the assignments.  The rest, I referred to code from exercises we had done in class.  I also utilized the AI expert in the bootcamp resources, and chat GPT. 

The end of both of my assignments, (where I output the code onto a text file), was done with the help of TA, Javier Vargas.  Other than that, I mainly relied on the in-class exercises to help me navigate through the assignment.
